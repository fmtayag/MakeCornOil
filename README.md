<h3>Now you can make vegetable oil from corn and water.</h3>
<p>It requires the following ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>10 units of Water</b></li>
<li><b>30x Corn</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, have these items on hand:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mortar and Pestle</b></li>
<li><b>Empty Bowl</b></li>
<li><b>Spoon</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, you'll need at least <u><b>Level 3 Cooking</b></u> to produce 1x Vegetable Oil.</p>

<h3>Dev notes</h3>
<p>I originally made this mod for my private server and single-player saves, and I had always intended it to be used alongside <a href=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2762018937>Mo' Crops</a> and <a href=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832136889>Sapph's Cooking</a>. Should you choose not to use any of those, however, the mod will work just fine - it's just going to be hard getting all those corn!</p>
